    Project Description
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">The current project "Bondily" aims to enhance the connections among family members by 
      providing a shared journaling space where they can comfortably share their life, thoughts, and emotional 
      experiences with each other through journaling. Through such a shared, collaborative journaling app, family 
      members can form their own private journaling space and interact with each other on a deeper level.</p>

    <h3 class="display-6 py-5">Introduction</h3>
    <hr class="my-4">
    
    <p>This project will assist users in connecting with their family members, particularly those whom 
      users are physically distant or away from, by providing them with a fun and creative way to keep 
      the family bonds strong: writing a collaborative, shared digital journal. Currently, most users 
      seem to communicate with their family members through calls and texts remotely, but conversations 
      in these forms could often only reach so far. The activity of keeping a shared journal between close 
      family members could not only provide an alternative way for families to stay in touch but also foster 
      an environment for greater emotional connections, even when they may be far apart in distance.

      
    <p>Through this UX project, I hope to provide family members, especially those who are physically away 
      from one another, with a way to share their emotional experiences and little things in life with each 
      other through a form of a journal. The 'Bond' in Bondily comes from the word 'Bond' which represents a 
      relationship between people or groups based on shared feelings, interests, or experiences, and
      'ily' comes from the last 3 characters in the word 'Family' to form 'Bondily', which conveys my aim of
      fostering greater emotional connections among family members through my product.

    Design Statement
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">The key question that guided my project is: 
      How can I design a user-friendly app that could strengthen the bonds among physically distant family members?
   </p>
    <p class="card-text"> Through my extensive research and design process detailed in below sections, I identified 
      my target users, their current challenges in terms of connecting with family members, and designed and prototyped
      my product to address user challenges and provide a creative solution.

      <h5 class="card-title">Heuristic Evaluation</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
      As a competitor analysis, I conducted a heuristic evaluation on two apps that aimed to achieve similar goals to mine. 
        The first is Waffle, a collaborative journal app that is intended to be used by with those whom users are close. 
        The app allows a group of members to create a shared journaling space where each member can share their thoughts 
        and experiences. The second app is eFamily, which allows a group of users to form a "family" with the goal of 
        having them stay in touch with each other effortlessly. The app allows each user to share their "moments" as 
        well as create a collaborative family album that consists of photos and videos of family memories, history, 
        and more. The evaluations are based on the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design developed by 
        Jakob Nielsen. The severity of the violation of each heuristic for each app is rated on a scale of 0-4.
      </p>
      
      <p class="card-text">
        Based on this heuristic evaluation, I identified key potential issues that I should take into consideration when designing my product:
        <ul>
          <li> The ambiguity of icon usage that does not necessarily follow the standard conventions.</li> 
          <li> The confusing two-part settings page.</li> 
          <li> Insufficient ways for users to get help and a lack of documentation.</li> 
      </ul>

      <h5 class="card-title">Usability Testing</h5>
       <p class="card-text">
        Through usability testing, I aimed to learn about how usable the Waffle app is, especially for novel users, and 
        find what issues there are within the app that could impede the app's user experience. Creating tasks for 
        the usability test based on key issues found during the heuristic evaluation, I observed how the participant 
        user interacted and navigated through different sections of the app as well as the challenges they encountered 
        while completing the tasks. 
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">
        My user was able to complete all of the tasks with relative ease throughout the usability testing process, 
        which mostly indicated that the Waffle app was user-friendly and nicely built even for novel users. 
        Nevertheless, I was able to find some usability issues that existed in the app such as confusing icon 
        usage, lack of documentation, and duplicate settings system.

      <h5 class="card-title">Contextual Inquiry</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
       In this stage, rather than focusing on the app, I focused the research on the user themselves, learning 
        about their goals, challenges with the current ways they try to achieve their goals, and their thought 
        process behind each action they make when using different mobile applications. Through this process, 
        I was able to gain significant insights into who my target user groups would be and what aspects I 
        should consider when designing my product based on their current challenges. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="card-text">
       Some insightful findings I gathered from the contextual inquiry are:
        <ul>
          <li> The user's difficulty in their current method of connection (calling/ texting /FaceTiming) 
            involved the differences in time zones, the limitations in technology, and the necessity to 
            use multiple different apps to cater to what each of their family members was most comfortable using. </li> 
          <li> The user finds a shared journal with their family members useful for remembering or 
            reflecting on past events.</li> 
          <li> Some concerns that the user had about the idea of keeping a shared journal included the 
            difficulty of consistently writing the journal entries and getting used to the digital 
            format of the journal, especially for older people like parents.</li>

      <h5 class="card-title">UX Storytelling</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        By identifying my target users through insights gained during the contextual inquiry step, I derived two personas:
      </p>
      
      <p class="card-text">
        1) Jongseok Park: a small coffee shop owner in Korea with two daughters who are currently studying abroad; his goal is to connect with his daughters and provide greater emotional support even when they are physically apart. 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">  
        2) Rachel Woods: a Master/Ph.D. student whose goal is to make and record more valuable memories with her family. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="card-text">
        Through UX storytelling – creating personas and their scenarios – I learned more about my target 
        audience by empathizing with the user's perspective. It allowed me to experience from the user's 
        perspective and essentially "live" my user's world as if I personally knew them. Conducting UX 
        storytelling further allowed me as a UX designer to focus on users' needs, goals, behaviors, 
        and motivations by getting away from potential biases and personal opinions in creating the product. 
        Creating journey maps for the two personas, I was able to understand potential frustrations in users’ 
        current situations and derive solutions using my product.

      <p class="card-text"> 
      Designing the low-fidelity prototype, I visualized the abstract idea of my product by creating basic 
        outlines and structures and testing their functionalities with a user by observing potential 
        issues and difficulties in navigating through the app. Deriving various user tasks, I was able 
        to identify potential issues that could arise in each part of the app and revise them accordingly 
        based on the user’s feedback and insights. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="card-text"> 
        Conducting a low-fidelity prototype testing with a participant user, 
        I identified a few issues such as the ambiguity of certain icons, 
        readability issues with some buttons, infinite scrolling problems, and 
        the unnecessary two-step process of achieving a certain task. Based on this 
        feedback, I revised the prototype to eliminate sources of confusion and make the 
        transition easier and smooth.

      <p class="card-text">
      In this interface design process, I converted one of the low-fidelity screens into a high-fidelity screen, 
        testing out different design schemes and selecting the design that best suits the project in terms of 
        accessibility and the app's value propositions. This involved making different colors, shapes, and 
        typographic variations and performing accessibility checks such as color-contrast tests. </p>
        
      <p class="card-text">
        Testing the initial interface design system with a participant user, I gathered user feedback and revised the screen 
        accordingly. By doing so, I derived a design scheme for the app that thoroughly follows the interface 
        design principles but also best demonstrates the functionalities and the features I aimed to present 
        in my product.

    High-Fidelity Prototype

  <div class="card-body">
    <p> 
    The final step of this project was to create a high-fidelity prototype for all screens that 
      supported my user tasks. By doing so, I was able to test out the functionality of the 
      various components, features, and aspects of the screens. Being a high-fidelity interactive 
      prototype, this closely demonstrates what the end product would look like as well as how the 
      user will be navigating through different aspects of the app. 
    </p>
    
    <p> 
    Through prototype testing with a participant user, I gathered insights on potential issues and 
      revised the prototype in a way that provides more user freedom in performing tasks, better 
      alignments, and fixes minor design details for a better user experience.

<h3 class="display-6 py-5">Conclusion</h3>
<hr class="my-4">
  <p> Having the opportunity to conduct the entire UX project was a very rewarding experience, delving into each process in detail and progressing toward building an app. 
    Throughout this project, I learned so much from conducting user research and interviews to designing and prototyping a mobile application. For each step of this project, 
    I learned that there is much more to designing a product than just the sole design process – besides the designing stage, conducting user research was crucial in identifying
    who our target users are, the struggles that they face, and how my product can assist them in providing a solution to their challenges. Processes such as usability testing 
    and contextual inquiry helped me learn about my target users’ goals and their tendencies in performing each action while interacting with technology. I am grateful for the 
    opportunity to conduct tests with multiple user participants, whether that be in prototype testings or cognitive walkthroughs, which provided me great insights into identifying 
    potential issues and sources of improvements I could revise in order to create a better user experience for my product. Though each step in the project took a great amount of 
    time as it required hands-on interviews, conducting thoughtful analyses, and creating functional designs, I am proud of how this project came along as well as the skills and 
    knowledge I gained. 
 </p> 
 <p>
   In future projects, I hope to try conducting multiple rounds of usability and prototype tests, which could help me gather more insights and thereby better tailor my designs 
   to various user groups. Moreover, I would like to try out different design schemes to explore various design components that I have yet to experience and expand the realm 
   of my creativity as a UX designer.
