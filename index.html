    Project Description
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">The current project "Bondily" aims to enhance the connections among family members by providing a shared journaling space where they can comfortably share their 
      life, thoughts, and emotional experiences with each other through journaling. Through such shared, collaborative journaling app, family members can form their own private journaling space 
      and interact with each other in a deeper level.</p>

    <h3 class="display-6 py-5">Introduction</h3>
    <hr class="my-4">
    
    <p>This project will assist users in connecting with their family members, particularly those whom users are physically distant or away from, by providing them with a fun and 
      creative way to keep the family bonds strong: writing a collaborative, shared digital journal. Currently, most users seem to remotely communicate with their family members 
      through calls and texts, but conversations in these forms could often only reach so far. The activity of keeping a shared journal between close family members could not only 
      provide an alternative way for families to stay in touch but also foster an environment for greater emotional connections, even when they may be far apart in distance.
      
    <p>Through this UX project, I hope to provide family members, especially those who are physically away from one another, with a way to share their emotional experiences and 
    little things in life with each other through a form of a shared, collaborative journaling app. In doing so, I aim to foster a greater emotional connection and stronger 
    bonds among family members.

      <h5 class="card-title">Heuristic Evaluation</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
      As a competitor analysis, I conducted a heuristic evaluation on two apps that aimed to achieve similar goals to mine. 
        The first is Waffle, a collaborative journal app that is intended to be used by with those whom users are close. 
        The app allows a group of members to create a shared journaling space where each member can share their thoughts 
        and experiences. The second app is eFamily, which allows a group of users to form a "family" with the goal of 
        having them stay in touch with each other effortlessly. The app allows each user to share their "moments" as 
        well as create a collaborative family album that consists of photos and videos of family memories, history, 
        and more. The evaluations are based on the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design developed by 
        Jakob Nielsen and the severity of the violation of each heuristic for each app is rated on a scale of 0-4.
      </p>
      
      <p class="card-text">
        1) Waffle is easy to navigate through different features and displays simplistic and aesthetic UI designs 
        to best serve a function as a shared journaling platform. There are changes, however, that should be made 
        in order to enhance the user experience of the app and avoid confusion such as adding detailed documentation, 
        providing a way to get help, and reducing errors. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="card-text">
        2) eFamily employs a simplistic design that focuses on its main goals of connecting family and friends together, 
        but there are major changes that need to be made in order to enhance the user experience of the app; currently, 
        many features of the app lack in terms of functionalities, keeping users informed about their actions, and 
        providing help and documentation.

      <h5 class="card-title">Usability Testing</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
       Through usability testing, I aimed to learn about how usable the Waffle app is, especially for novel users, 
      and find what issues there are within the app that could impede the app's user experience. Creating tasks 
      for the usability test based on key issues found during the heuristic evaluation, I observed how the participant 
      user interacted and navigated through different sections of the app as well as the challenges they encountered 
      while completing the tasks.

      <p class="card-text">
       In this stage, rather than focusing on the app, I focused the research on the user themselves, learning about
      their goals, challenges with the current ways they try to achieve their goals, and their thought process 
      behind each action they make when using different mobile applications. Through this process, I was able to 
      gain significant insights into who my target user groups would be and what aspects I should consider when 
      designing my product based on their current challenges.

      <h5 class="card-title">UX Storytelling</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        Through UX storytelling – creating personas and their scenarios – I was able to learn more about my target audience 
        by empathizing with the user's perspective. It allowed me to experience from the user's perspective and essentially 
        "live" my user's world as if I personally knew them. Conducting UX storytelling further allowed me as a UX designer 
        to focus on users' needs, goals, behaviors, and motivations by getting away from potential biases and personal 
        opinions in creating the product. Ultimately, the story is for the users, not myself.

        in navigating through the app. Deriving various user tasks, I was able to identify potential issues that could 
        arise in each part of the app and revise them accordingly based on the user’s feedback and insights.</p>
