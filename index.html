    Project Description
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">The current project "Bondily" aims to enhance the connections among family members by providing a shared journaling space where they can comfortably share their 
      life, thoughts, and emotional experiences with each other through journaling. Through such shared, collaborative journaling app, family members can form their own private journaling space 
      and interact with each other in a deeper level.</p>

    <h3 class="display-6 py-5">Introduction</h3>
    <hr class="my-4">
    
    <p>Growing up, both of my parents worked and in middle school, I got to study abroad in America alone, thanks to my grateful parents. Therefore, I was physically distant from my family for a significant amount of my life time. 
    Even though I visited home every summer, most of our family time would consist of shallow conversation about what each of us was doing and watching a show or two together. 
    After catching up and spending time together for a month or so like this, each of us would all go back and focus on our own lives yet again. 
    Though we were just physically away from each other, I felt that we were getting emotionally farther apart as time passed. 
    I rarely bothered sharing my thoughts and emotions, or engage in 'deep talks' with my family since I got so used to making decisions independently and our family simply could not make the space nor the time to do so. 
    Occasionally, I found myself missing the deep talks that I had with my dad, jokingly planning a creative sister business with my older sister, and getting advice from my mom about how to choose the right guy to date. 
    I wanted to re-establish the strong emotional connection with my family again, even though we may be physically distant.

    <p>Through this UX project, I hope to provide family members, especially those who are physically away from one another, with a way to share their emotional experiences and 
    little things in life with each other through a form of a shared, collaborative journaling app. In doing so, I aim to foster a greater emotional connection and stronger 
    bonds among family members.
