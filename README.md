# DH110 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Haryn Shin
## Enhancing Family Connection Through a Shared Journal 

Growing up, both of my parents worked and in middle school, I got to study abroad in America alone, thanks to my grateful parents. Therefore, I was physically distant from my family for a significant amount of my life time. Even though I visited home every summer, most of our family time would consist of shallow conversation about what each of us was doing and watching a show or two together. After catching up and spending time together for a month or so like this, each of us would all go back and focus on our own lives yet again. Though we were just physically away from each other, I felt that we were getting emotionally farther apart as time passed. I rarely bothered sharing my thoughts and emotions, or engage in 'deep talks' with my family since I got so used to making decisions independently and our family simply could not make the space nor the time to do so. Occasionally, I found myself missing the deep talks that I had with my dad, jokingly planning a creative sister business with my older sister, and getting advice from my mom about how to choose the right guy to date. I wanted to re-establish the strong emotional connection with my family again, even though we may be physically distant. 

Through this UX project, I hope to provide family members, especially those who are physically away from one another, with a way to share their emotional experiences and little things in life with each other through a form of a shared, collaborative journaling app. In doing so, I aim to foster a greater emotional connection and stronger bonds among family members. 

For assignment 1, I will be conducting heuristic evaluations on two apps that aimed to achieve similar goals to mine. The first is Waffle, a collaborative journal app that is intended to be used with those whom users are close with. The app allows a group of members to create a shared journaling space where each member can share their thoughts and experiences. The second app is eFamily, which allows a group of users to form a "family" with the goal of having them stay in touch with each other effortlessly. The app allows each users to share their "moments" as well as create a collaborative family album that consists of photos and videos of family memories, history, and more. The evaluations will be based on the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) developed by Jakob Nielsen and the severity of the violation of each heuristic for each app will be rated on a scale of 0-4.
