# Bondily: Enhancing Family Connection Through a Shared Journal
## UX project for UCLA DH110 course // Haryn Shin
### Project Description 
The current project "Bondily" aims to enhance the connections among family members by providing a shared journaling space where they can comfortably share their life, thoughts, and emotional experiences with each other through journaling. Through such shared, collaborative journaling app, family members can form their own private journaling space and interact with each other in a deeper level.

Through this UX project, I hope to provide family members, especially those who are physically away from one another, with a way to share their emotional experiences and little things in life with each other through a form of a shared, collaborative journaling app. In doing so, I aim to foster a greater emotional connection and stronger bonds among family members.
