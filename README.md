# DH110 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Haryn Shin
## Bondily : Enhancing Family Connection Through a Shared Journal

Growing up, both of my parents worked and in middle school, I got to study abroad in America alone, thanks to my grateful parents. Therefore, I was physically distant from my family for a significant amount of my life time. Even though I visited home every summer, most of our family time would consist of shallow conversation about what each of us was doing and watching a show or two together. After catching up and spending time together for a month or so like this, each of us would all go back and focus on our own lives yet again. Though we were just physically away from each other, I felt that we were getting emotionally farther apart as time passed. I rarely bothered sharing my thoughts and emotions, or engage in 'deep talks' with my family since I got so used to making decisions independently and our family simply could not make the space nor the time to do so. Occasionally, I found myself missing the deep talks that I had with my dad, jokingly planning a creative sister business with my older sister, and getting advice from my mom about how to choose the right guy to date. I wanted to re-establish the strong emotional connection with my family again, even though we may be physically distant. 

Through this UX project, I hope to provide family members, especially those who are physically away from one another, with a way to share their emotional experiences and little things in life with each other through a form of a shared, collaborative journaling app. In doing so, I aim to foster a greater emotional connection and stronger bonds among family members. 

For assignment 1, I will be conducting heuristic evaluations on two apps that aimed to achieve similar goals to mine. The first is Waffle, a collaborative journal app that is intended to be used with those whom users are close with. The app allows a group of members to create a shared journaling space where each member can share their thoughts and experiences. The second app is eFamily, which allows a group of users to form a "family" with the goal of having them stay in touch with each other effortlessly. The app allows each users to share their "moments" as well as create a collaborative family album that consists of photos and videos of family memories, history, and more. The evaluations will be based on the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) developed by Jakob Nielsen and the severity of the violation of each heuristic for each app will be rated on a scale of 0-4. 

## App #1: Waffle

**App Description**
Waffle is a collaborative journaling app for close family and friends that provides a collective space for each member of the journal to share their thoughts, experiences, and emotions. Through Waffle, the app developers aimed to enhance the connection and relationship among members, especially by allowing each individual to express emotions and empathize with one another. 

As users enter the app, they can create a collaborative journal, give a name for it, and start adding members whom they want to journal with in the specific journal. There are daily prompts generated by the app to guide users write about a specific topic, but users can also choose to journal about a topic of their choice as a default.

**Heuristic Evaluation**
Overall Evaluation: The app is easy to navigate through different features and display simplistic and aesthetic UI designs to best serve a function as a shared journaling platform. There are changes, however, that should be made in order to enhance the user experience of the app and avoid confusion such as adding detailed documentation, providing a way to get help, and reducing errors. The heuristic evaluation conducted below details a on-by-one evaluation of the app based on the 10 Usability Heuristics.

## App #2: eFamily

**App Description**
eFamily is an app in which users can create a collaborative album with their close ones and also share media, interact with others' shared media, and interact with others within a shared space called a "Family". On the app, a group of users can form a family group, share written posts, photos/ videos, or add media to their shared album with the aim of recording their valuable memories on the platform. Through eFamily, the app developers aimed to keep families in touch and allow users to look back and bond over shared memories.

**Heuristic Evaluation**

Overall Evaluation: The app employs a simplistic design that focuses on its main goals of connecting family and friends together, but there are major changes that need to be made in order to enhance the user experience of the app; currently, many features of the app lack in terms of functionalities, keeping users informed about their actions, and providing help and documentation. The heuristic evaluation conducted below details a on-by-one evaluation of the app based on the 10 Usability Heuristics.
