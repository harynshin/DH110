# DH110 Assignment 04: Personas & Scenarios by Haryn Shin
## Introduction
**The purpose of UX story telling**
- The purpose of UX story telling is to learn more about the audience by empathizing with the user's perspective. Ultimately, the story is for the users, not ourselves. We can conduct the UX story telling by creating personas and appropriate scenarios for the personas; this allows us to experience in the user's perspective and essentially "live" our user's world as if we personally know them. Excercising UX story telling further allows us as UX designers to focus on user's needs, goals, behaviors and motivations by getting away from potential biases and personal opinions in creating the product. 

**Two tasks for the ux design**

The two tasks that are proposed as a design solution in enhancing family connection are as follows:
- First, the users will navigate through and explore the different functionalities of the shared journaling app, thinking or talking their thought process out loud.
- Second, the users will try to invite their family members to the journal and write a journal entry on the app.

## Scenarios: Two Stories
### Jongseok's Scenario:
**Why is Jongseok using the product?:**
> Jongseok is a small cafe shop owner based in Seoul, South Korea, who recently sent his two daughters to study abroad in different states of the US. Because he can't physically see his daughters for most of the year, Jongseok tries to stay in touch with his daughters by calling and texting his daughters daily. However, he realizes that such way of staying in contact with his daughters comes with challenges; first, the different time zones among him and his daughters made it hard to schedule the best time for them to connect. It was hard to set a fixed time to call because he knew that his daughters also had responsibilities and unexpected things could come up. Second, the limitations of technology such as continual lags prevented them from having smooth conversations and often led to miscommunications, which eventually allowed them to only make short calls and do the rest through texting. This made it hard for Jongseok to have deeper conversations with his daughters that involved sharing thoughts and emotional experiences to better understand if they had any problems, need advice, and such. Jongseok is often worried about her daughters and feels sorry that he can't provide tangible support due to the physical distance. He wants to still be able to be a supportive dad even thought they may be apart in physical distance by keeping a shared online family journal with his wife and daughters.

**How is Jongseok using the product?:**
> In the morning, Jongseok wakes up to a couple of notifications from the shared journaling app about posts that his daughters posted. He clicks on the notification to enter the app. On the "feed page", he first reads about his oldest daughter Jieun's journal entry of the day, where she posts about a professional career conference she attended at her university. Jongseok scrolls down to the reactions tab and likes Jieun's post by tapping on the heart emoji. Then, he proceeds to the comments tab and writes "You have grown so much, the conference looks amazing!". Jongseok scrolls up to a journal entry posted by his younger daughter Jisoo, who wrote about how she's having a hard time in understanding the materials in her high school chemistry class. Jongseok clicks on the comments tab again and writes about an advice that he wants to give for Jisoo. After reading his daughters' journal entries, he clicks on the pencil icon to share his journal entry of the day with his daughters. He titles it and proceeds to write about how proud he is of his daughters. At the end, he signs it off by writing "I love you guys, have a great night!". He submits the journal entry by hitting the "post" button, and waits for his dauthers' reactions and comments.

### Rachel's Scenario:
**Why is Rachel is using the product?:**
> Rachel is a student at Purdue University working towards attaining her Masters and PHD in the field of psychology. She hopes to becomes a professor specifically in the field of social psychology in the future. After the recent passing of her beloved grandma, she feels regretful about how she didn't have a lot of memories with her grandma to look back on since she often didn't record the times she spent with her grandma. She realizes the significant value of recording valuable memories of her and her family and remembering in the future. She decides to do so through taking photos of happy moments spent with her family and uploading them online along with some writings about the family events and how she felt. Since she wants to keep records of valuable family memories, she also invites her family members to contribute to the shared journal as well, making the connection and interaction more fun and meaningful.

**How is Rachel using the product?:**
> On a sunny weekend, Rachel plans a family trip to Palm Springs to take time off from her rigorous studies and spend some time with her mom and sister. At Palm Springs, she takes a lot of photos of the scenary, family selfies in pretty destinations, and the amazing barbeque dinner that they all cooked together. After the short trip, Rachel goes on the app and enters her family journaling space by clicking on the journal book icon. She presses the pencil icon and titles the journal entry "Woods family's weekend getaway to Palm Springs". She clicks on the photo icon to choose multiple photos from the trip and upload them to the journal entry. Then, she moves on to the body paragraph and writes about the things that she and her family did, the food they ate, and the overnight conversations they had. She posts the journal entry and posts it. She then scrolls through the feed to see what her mom posted and finds the family selfie that her mom took during the trip. Rachel clicks on the photo and clicks on the save icon to save it to her camera roll. She doesn't forget to like her mom's journal entry and comment "It was so fun!". At last, she scrolls through the feed of her family journal to look back on what her family did a year ago and reads about the time when the family gathered for ThanksGiving. She takes some time to read and look at the photos she posted at that time and presses the "sahre" icon to sahre it to her family groupchat within the app with a message saying, "Look, Emily [her little sister] was so young in this photo!".
