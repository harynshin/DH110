# DH110 Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype by Haryn Shin
## Introduction
### Project Description
The current project "Bondily" aims to enhance the connections among family members by providing a shared journaling space where they can comfortably share their life, thoughts, and emotional experiences with each other through journaling. Through such shared, collaborative journaling app, family members can form their own private journaling space and interact with each other in a deeper level.

### Overview of Interactive Prototype
The purpose and process of this interactive prototype phase (3-5 sentences)

## Tasks
The following lists the tasks that are supported by my interactive prototypes. These tasks are mostly based on the tasks that were presented for [Low Fidelity Prototype](https://github.com/harynshin/DH110-HARYNSHIN/blob/main/Assignments/A5_lowfi_prototype.md), with a few changes to match the updates that I have made since. 

- Task 1: Write a journal entry about your summer plans and upload photos from your photo album to the journal entry
- Task 2: Invite a member to your shared journal
- Task 3: Search for journal entries that contain the word "vacations"
- Task 4: Find pictures that “Mom” posted from the Gallery tab
- Task 5: Put a reaction emoji of your choice and write a comment to a journal entry by "Mom"
