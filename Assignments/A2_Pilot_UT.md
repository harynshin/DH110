# DH110 Assignment 02: Usability Testing by Haryn Shin

## Introduction
The app that I conducted the usability testing for is the [Waffle app](https://www.wafflejournal.com/). This app is a collaborative journaling app that provides a group of users a space to interact within a shared, interactive journal. The app allows users to create a journal based on their preference, invite collaborators to the journal, and share some snippets of their lives with the members of the journal. Through this app, Waffle aims to enhance the connections between families and friends by creating stronger emotional bonds among the members. 

The purpose of the usability testing is to learn about how usable the Waffle app is, especially for novel users, and find what issues there are within the app that could impede the app's user experience. Through the Waffle app's heuristic evaluation, I found that there are three key issues: 
1) The ambiguity of icon usage that does not necessarily follow the standard conventions. 
2) The confusing two-part settings page.
3) Insufficient ways for users to get help and a lack of documentation.

Therefore, the tasks in the usability testing process were designed to cover all three of these aspects while also see how the user interacts and navigates through different parts of the app in general. 

## Methods
The usability testing was conducted in a reserved lounge room at UCLA, administered in a form of survey questionnaires and performing tasks. The test is consisted of the following sections:
- **Introduction**: introducting participant to the usability testing process
- **Informed Consent**: obtaining participant consent for participation
- **Background Information**: questions regarding participant's app usage
- **Pre-test Questionnaire**: gauging and assessing participant's first impression of the app
- **Tasks**: 4 tasks for participant to solve by navigating through the app
- **Post-test Questionnaire**: recording participant's experience and feedback about the app
- **Background Information about the participant**: participant's demographics information
- **Conclusion**: Thank you screen & submission of the survey responses

## Summary of Findings
My user was able to complete all of the tasks with relative ease throughout the usability testing process, which mostly indicated that the Waffle app was user-friendly and nicely built even for novel users. Nevertheless, I was able to find some usability issues that existed for the app. Though these could be minor issues that could be easily fixed, the usability testing process was crucial in understanding how the app could be improved and what aspects to keep in mind when designing an app for users. Below details the findings regarding the three key issues of the app that I aimed to explore through the usability testing tasks.

**1) The ambiguity of icon usage that does not necessarily follow the standard conventions**
- This turned out to be an issue during usability testing, confirming the findings in the heuristic evaluation. Initially, when shown screenshots of the app, the user thought that the looking glass icon (üîé) would serve as a function to search keywords in the journal. However, upon clicking the icon, the app presents a premium plan upgrade screen, which is unexpected and does not necessarily follow the conventional usage of the particular icon. 
-  The user also assumed that the three bars (‚ò∞) would be a menu bar with different options, but it instead shows just the specific journal's settings page. The standard settings icon or the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) would be more intuitive and recognizable for users.
-  Overall, such usage of icons would not be as intuitive and this could be improved by closely following the conventional icon usage or, if the icons cannot be replaced, documenting what the icons do and where they lead users to for further improvement. 

**2) The two-part settings system**
- During the heuristic evaluation stage, I thought that the two-part settings system (one settings page for the overall app usage such as notifications, account information, and system settings, and another settings page for the specific journal) would be confusing to users and lead to unnecessary back-and-forths for users to find the correct settings. Through task 3, I aimed to test this out by having the user set specific things up on both of the settings page. 
- Though at first, the user seemed a bit challenged by learning what specific settings were located at (such as the journal text size), the user managed to quickly learn about them and complete the tasks. Nevertheless, to minimize the user's cognitive load from the beginning, combining the settings pages into one could be more efficient in terms of improvement.  

**3) Insufficient ways for users to get help & a lack of documentation**
- Though the user was able to find the "send a feedback" option on the app during task 4, suggesting that users have some ways to get help when running into an issue, the user still showed some struggles with the app's insufficient documentation. For instance, the user failed to acknowledge the plus button (+) to find the unique journal code for inviting collaborators, and instead went to the journal settings page to manually invite the collaborators. 
- These user behaviors suggest that the app lacks documentations informing users what to do for different features and buttons. The app can be improved by adding brief documentations below or when users press-hold a partiular feature that tell them how functions like inviting collaborators work. 

Aside from these major findings, there were some other issues that were detected during the usability testing: first, the "Today's question" prompt provided user with a link to an article to look at and write about it, but it wasn't a hyperlink and the user could not click or copy the link to access the article. Secondly, the unique journal code was not as apparent to the user immediately. 

In addition, a few things that the user directly indicated that they did not like about the app included things such as misleading icons/categories in the app and frequent pop-ups that prompted the user to buy the Waffle Premium plan. The user suggested that it would be better if the app relocated certain categories (e.g. "Give Us Feedback" section to the bottom of Settings page) and used the standard gear icon for the settings page instead of pairing with the rest of the account page since currently, all of the settings are accessible by clicking the user's profile, which is not as intuitive and typical.

## Reflection
Through the pilot UT test, I was able to learn about the roles of a moderator and a participant in a usability testing setting. Throughout the testing, I found myself being urged to encourage the user when they were able to complete the tasks well and to give hints for the parts they were struggling, which was the most challenging part for me during the test. Moreover, because I was testing one of my best friends in a rather serious setting, it was hard to keep a straight face during the entirety of the test. There were also minor technical issues at the beginning with regards to problems with wifi connection, which was unexpected, but thankfully it resolved fairly quickly and we were able to resume the recording. Overall, nevertheless, I think the test went smoothly and my participant friend also did a very good job in trying to think and talk aloud though it may be unusual, expressing their thoughts about the app, and providing good insights for the app's improvment. In future UT sessions, I hope to improve my UT by rehearsing the UT more and adjusting questionnaires or preparing materials well before the real session to prevent unexpected situations from occurring. Also, I would try practicing a professional tone and behavior so that the participant could also participate in the test in a genuine manner.
