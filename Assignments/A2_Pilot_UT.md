# DH110 Assignment 02: Usability Testing by Haryn Shin

## Introduction
The app that I conducted the usability testing for is the [Waffle app](https://www.wafflejournal.com/). This app is a collaborative journaling app that provides a group of users a space to interact within a shared, interactive journal. The app allows users to create a journal based on their preference, invite collaborators to the journal, and share some snippets of their lives to the members of the journal. Through this app, Waffle aims to enhance the connections between families and friends by creating stronger emotional bonds among the members. 

The purpose of the usability testing is to learn about how usable the Waffle app is, especially for novel users, and detect what issues there are within the app that could impede the app experience. Through the Waffle app's heuristic evaluation, I found that there were three key issues: the ambiguity of icon usage that does not necessarily follow the standard conventions, the confusing two-part settings page, and insufficient ways for users to get immediate help. Therefore, the tasks in the usability testing process were designed to cover all three of these aspects while also seeing how the user interacts and navigates through different parts of the app overall. 

## Methods
The usability testing was conducted in a reserved lounge room at UCLA, administered in a form of survey questionnaires and solving given tasks. The survey is consisted of the following sections:
- Introduction
- Informed Consent
- Background Information: questions regarding participant's app usage
- Pre-test Questionnaire: gauging and assessing participant's first impression of the app
- Tasks: 4 tasks for participant to solve by navigating through the app
- Post-test Questionnaire: recording participant's experience and feedback about the app
- Background Information about the participant: participant's demographics information
- Conclusion

## Summary of Findings
My user was able to complete all of the tasks with relative ease throughout the usability testing process, which mostly indicated that the Waffle app was user-friendly and nicely built for even novel users. Nevertheless, I was able to find some usability issues that existed for the app. Though these could be minor issues that could be easily fixed, the usability testing process was crucial in understanding how the app could be improved and what aspects to keep in mind when designing an app for users. With Waffle, 

## Reflection
One paragraph describing what you learned during the pilot test, what went well and what did not go well, focusing on how you want to improve your UT in the future.
