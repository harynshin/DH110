# DH110 Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry by Haryn Shin
## ğŸ“‹ Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements
**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**

_How can I design an user-friendly, effortless app that could strengthen the bonds among physically distant family members?_

> This project will assist users in connecting with their family members, particularly those whom users are physically distant or away from, by providing them a fun and creative way to keep the family bonds strong: writing a collaborative, shared digital journal. Currently, most users seem to remotely communicate with their family members through calls and texts, but conversations in these forms could often only reach so far. The activity of keeping a shared journal between close family members could not only provide an alternative way for families to stay in touch, but also foster an environment for greater emotional connections, even when they may be far apart in distance. 

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
> This activity aims to enhance the relationship and connection among family members effortlessly, even if they may be phsycially away from one another. By recording and sharing snippets of each member's life, emotional experiences and thoughts, and interacting with each other's journal entries on the shared family journal, users will be able to stay in contact with their distant family members easily and further feel at home. 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> The traditional solution as to satisfying such goals or needs of staying in touch with distant family members could vary by different individuals; some may choose to make calls to their family members occasionally, others may text them on a daily basis to stay connected. With the advancement of technology in the current world, users have tools such as FaceTiming or Zoom, through which users experiences a more vivid and real-time connections. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**
> Though they provide the most basic and essential ways of communication, the limitations as to relying on calls and texts are that first, users with distant family members may find the differing time zones challenging. Moreover, users may not always be able to engage in rather long and deeper conversations within these means and more of a casual, catching-up conversations, which, again for some users, may not be that helpful in sharing their deep thoughts and emotional experiences with their family members. 

## ğŸ“‹ Step 2: Target users
**What are the characteristics of users?** 
- Demographics: Any users that are currently physically distant from their family members; example personnel could be international and out-of-state students or working adults/ professionals. 
- Preference: users who are willing to connect or enhance their connections with their family members; users who are motivated to connect with their families more often and maintain strong bonds with them would be ideal.  
- Expertise: users would not need any level of expertise for this user interview.

**In which context would the users do that activity?**
- Where: A reserved lounge at UCLA
- Why: 
- Conditions (Under which conditions): 

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
- In order to stay in touch with their distant family members, users would try calling or texting their missed members frequently, converse about simple things like how their days were like to more deeper conversations like current issues, personal problems, advice, and more. They may also utilize various social media platforms to connect with them such as sharing media (pictures and videos) with each other, or engage in online gaming with each other to bond over entertainment activities like such. 

## ğŸ“‹ Step 3: Pick an qualitative research method
The methods used in conducting the user interview were a combination of an interview and participatory observation.

**Interview**

**Participatory Interaction**
- User decides to show how s/he does the activity in their usual way
- Things that go wrong (breakdowns, need to improve)
- Things that go smoothly (keep the current solution)
- User will explain why are things done as they are

## ğŸ“‹ Step 4: Plan the details
Brainstorm the right contexts and narrow down to decide where to visit physically and/or virtually
- Activities to observation: 
- Decide how to interact with the users (ex. overt x participatory if it is contextual inquiry)
- Collecting user data: I plan to use my laptop in order to video record the whole user interview process, while voice recording on one hand using the iphone voice memos application as a back up as well as taking pen-paper observation notes during the interview.

## ğŸ“‹ Step 5: Conduct the research
After preparing the interview materials, I contacted the ideal participant, scheduled a time for an interview, and met them at a reserved lounge room at UCLA. Linked below are the digitaized observation notes, representative data file, and the full transcript of the interview.
