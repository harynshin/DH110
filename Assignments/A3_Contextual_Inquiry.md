# DH110 Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry by Haryn Shin
## ðŸ“‹ Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements
**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**

_How can I design an user-friendly app that could strengthen the bonds among physically distant family members?_

> This project will assist users in connecting with their family members, particularly those whom users are physically distant or away from, by providing them a fun and creative way to keep the family bonds strong: writing a collaborative, shared digital journal. Currently, most users seem to remotely communicate with their family members through calls and texts, but conversations in these forms could often only reach so far. The activity of keeping a shared journal between close family members could not only provide an alternative way for families to stay in touch, but also foster an environment for greater emotional connections, even when they may be far apart in distance. 

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
> This activity aims to enhance the relationships and connections among family members effortlessly, even if they may be phsycially away from one another. By recording and sharing snippets of each member's life, emotional experiences and thoughts, and interacting with each other's journal entries on the shared family journal, users will be able to stay in contact with their distant family members easily and further feel at home. 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> The traditional solution as to satisfying such goals or needs of staying in touch with distant family members could vary by different individuals; some may choose to make calls to their family members occasionally, others may text them on a daily basis to stay connected. With the advancement of technology in the current world, users have tools such as FaceTiming or Zoom, through which users are able to have vivid and real-time connections. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**
> Though calls and texts provide the most basic and essential ways of communication, the limitations as to relying on them are that first, users with distant family members may find the differing time zones challenging. Moreover, users may not always be able to engage in rather long and deeper conversations within these means and more of a casual, catching-up conversations, which, again for some users, may not be that helpful in sharing their deep thoughts and emotional experiences with their family members. 

## ðŸ“‹ Step 2: Target users
**What are the characteristics of users?** 
- Demographics: Any users that are currently physically distant from their family members; example personnel could be international and out-of-state students or working adults/ professionals. 
- Preference: users who are willing to connect or strengthen their connections with their family members; users who are motivated to connect with their families more often and maintain strong bonds with them would be ideal.  
- Expertise: users would not need any level of expertise for this user interview.

**In which context would the users do that activity?**
- Where: The user interview will be conducted at a reserved lounge at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA.
- Why: To enhance the connection with user's family members while being physically away, and try out a new method of remote connection in a form of a collaborative, shared journal. 
- Conditions: Under the conditions of protected confidentiality of user's responses, thinking/ talking aloud during the activities and interview questions, and video-recording of the interview. 

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
- In order to stay in touch with their distant family members, users would try calling or texting their missed members frequently, converse about from simple things like how their days were like to more deeper conversations like current issues, personal problems, seeking advice, and more. They may also utilize various social media platforms to connect with them such as sharing media (pictures and videos) with each other, or engage in online activities like gaming with each other to bond over entertainment activities like such. 

## ðŸ“‹ Step 3: Pick an qualitative research method
The methods used in conducting the user interview were a combination of an interview and participatory observation. The entire contextual inquiry session consisted of the following components: 

**Pre-Interview Questions**
- Background Questions: Assessed if the interviewee is an ideal participant for the user interview; asking questions regarding interviewee's family relationship, physical distance between interviewee and their family members, and interviewee's methods of connecting with their family members. 
- Contextual Inquiry: Gained more in-depth insights into user's connection behaviors and methods with their family members; insights into current and primary methods of connections, frequency of connection, content of connection (what they talk/ connect about), and the reasons or motivations behind connection. 

**Participatory Observation/ User Activity**
- User's current method of connection: Assessed how user currently connect with their family members in detail and what similarities or differences user finds in interacting with each of their family members. 
- User's journaling method: Assessed how user currently journals in detail such as their journal content and whether user shares it with their family members. 
- User activity: Paper journaling ([User Activity Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LUF26T4Kak-N0zmw59svijdqRyMDitAg/view?usp=sharing))
  - Had user make a hypothetical shared family journal, gathering inputs on how the user would make use of the future platform; these included what they would name the journal, who they would invite, what content they would write and share about with the journal members, what content they would expect to see from other members, and overall user's satisfaction with the idea and the tasks. 

**Post-Interview Questions**
- Problems: Assessed the difficulties that the user experiences with their current connection methods and possible concerns about the idea of a shared family journal. 
- Wrap-up Questions: Assessed the importance for user in connecting with their family members, user's satisfations with current connection methods, and more.  

## ðŸ“‹ Step 4: Plan the details
- Activities to observation: Interview questions and paper journaling activity.
- Interacting with the user: Interviewing the user in a form of multiple nested questions, gaining insights on the details.
- Collecting user data: Using one laptop to video-record the whole user interview process, using the iphone voice memos application to voice-record as a back up, and taking detailed observation notes during the interview on an ipad. 

## ðŸ“‹ Step 5: Conduct the research
After preparing the interview materials, I contacted the ideal participant, scheduled a time for an interview, and met them at a reserved lounge room at UCLA. Linked below are the digitaized observation notes, representative data file, and the full transcript of the interview.

### User Insights
Below details some significant insights the user provided during the contextual inquiry. 
- The user's difficulty in their current method of connection (calling/ texting /FaceTiming) involved the differences in time zones, the limitations in technology, and the necessity to use multiple different apps to cater to what each of their family members was most comfortable using.
  > Definitely as you mentioned, the time zone is different. We have like a three hour difference, so although we still live in the same nation, it feels like a lot of times, they're a lot further away, because I'll be eating dinner, and they'll be getting ready for bed...I have to calculate what time it is for them, because I don't want to wake them up like an alarm (28:48)

  > A lot of times technology just isn't perfect. So if you're like messaging them, sometimes text messages just won't go through for some reason, or like your phone will lag so you don't hear everything that someone else on the other line is saying, that's definitely a bit difficult (29:20)

  > "Personally, itâ€™s not the most convenient for me because I think that Iâ€™m like the person who is usually hopping across different apps to cater to whatever the other personâ€™s comfortable with using" (31:29)
- With the user's primary method of connecting with their family members, which was calling, users found themselves engaging in more of a short, catching-up-like conversations rather than deeper convsersations. 
  > "...in a more like an everyday situation, I feel like it's usually just like catching-up, kind of giving a recap of what's going on in my life. So I feel like...simple things that aren't that serious" (6:19)
- The user wished to share about their day, their feelings and emotions, as well as something they want to inform their family members like different weather conditions, with their family members on the shared journal. 
  > "...in the beginning like first half I would write like a short summary of like my day or like how I was feeling throughout the day, just because I think that, my family is very transparent with, like our emotions" (16:21)

  > "I would specifically write like something about the weather just because like, my family lives in a different area. So like, I can inform them about, like, what my specific day looked like" (18:45)
- The user finds a shared journal with their family members useful for remembering or reflecting on past events. 
  > "A lot of times, like you kind of want to remember, like in the future, like what you were doing in the past. And I guess it's kind of like the nostalgia kind of thing" (24:01)
- Some concerns that user had about the idea of keeping a shared journal included the difficulty of consistently writing the journal entries and getting used to the digital format of the journal, especially for older people like parents. 
  > "For me, like, I said it was a daily journal, so I personally would expect to be able to read three other entries everyday. But, obviously, life gets in the way, thatâ€™s not like [what] you can always do" (30:24) 

  > "Because my parents are a bit older, they are not as tech-savvy, it might be a little difficult for them to get used to, like, the digital format because theyâ€™re really, like, analogue â€“ they like to use things that they are already using, so I guess it could be a little difficult for them to kind of learn how to use this kind of whole new app for the sole purpose of journaling" (30:48)


## ðŸ“‹ Step 6: Reflection
Through this user interview, particularly using the contexual inquiry method, I was able to learn a lot about what a typical user interview consists of and what the process looks like. Initially, coming up with the questions and the user activity took a bit of time since I had to focus on what I can learn from the user rather than testing out an app or a product; therefore, I spent a significant amount of time constructing my questions in a way that user could comfortably provide answers regarding their personal experiences and behaviors. Overall, I believe that the interview went smoothly and my interviewee friend provided very detailed insights into the questions that they were asked, connecting well to their personal experiences when providing their responses -- a lot of good points were made that could positively contribute to designing my app. Looking back on the interview video, however, I realized that I could have done better by asking more specific and detailed questions about particular things such as the user's current method of connections and difficulties to get more specific insights; a lot of the times, I feel like I only asked the questions I have prepared in my script and did not further ask follow-up questions that could have elicited more specific responses from the user, especially for the questions that I considered important. In the future, I hope to take this lesson into account and not only closely follow my script but also not be hesitant to ask more questions outside of the script to learn more about the user's particular behaviors.
