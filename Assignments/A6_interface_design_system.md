# DH110 Assignment 06: Interface Design System by Haryn Shin
## Description of project
The current project "Bondily" aims to enhance the connections among family members by providing a shared journaling space where they can comfortably share their life, thoughts, and emotional experiences with each other through journaling. Through such shared, collaborative journaling app, family members can form their own private journaling space and interact with each other in a deeper level.

In this interface design process, I converted one of the low fidelity screens into a high fidelity screen, testing out different design schemes and selecting the design that best suits the project in terms of accessibility and the app's value propositions. Thus, the purpose of the interface design is to derive a design scheme for the app that thoroughly follows the design principles but also best demonstrates the functionalities and the features I aim to present through my app project. 

In terms of thee interface design process, I primarily used Figma to come up with different variations of the "Feeds" tab of my app, where users can mainly view family members' recent journal entries. With Figma, I made different variations in terms of typography, shapes and colors to test which design schemes could best serve the purpose of the shared, collaborative family journaling app. The dimensions of the screen frame I used was the standard Iphone 14 screen. For typographic variations, I made use of Google Fonts and the Figma plugin _Better Font Picker_ to test out different fonts, and for shapes and colors respectively, I adjusted the roundness of the element boxes as well as tested out different color schemes. The Screen design section that follows below details the information about the variations as well as the visuals.

## Accessibility (color-contrast) check
### Text color contrast check 
First, I used the Figma plugin _A11y - Color Contrast Checker_ to check the color accessibility for the text contents on the screen. Initially, there were quite a few errors so I adjusted the text colors of the texts to a darker color than I had for the previous design. After adjusting some lightness details as such, I was able to fix all the errors and meet the AAA color contrast requirements.

### Element color contrast check
Then, I moved on to test the color contrast for different elements or components of my screen with text. I used the FIgma plugin _Stark_ to check for the colors of these different elements.
